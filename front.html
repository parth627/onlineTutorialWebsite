        If you don’t know C, you don’t know what you are doing as a programmer. Sure, 
        your application works fine and all. But, if you can’t say why while (*s++ = *p++); copies a string, you’re programming on a superstition

          Fact: You cannot learn C programming in a day. You might have difficulty grasping
           the important concepts if you try to learn C programming faster.  
          If you just learn the syntax and dive in, your C code may work but
           you’ll not end up learning C programming the right way.,

        c pro  has dozens of examples that will help you understand C programming. However, if you are reading it like a novel without running it in your system, you are doing it wrong.
        If you want to learn a new feature of C programming, try to write code related to that feature. If you can’t,
         copy code from Programiz and run it in your system. Then, try to understand it. Once you understand it, modify the code, make it different and run it again.

Learn to use a Debugging tool
</h2>




<h style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic;">
  
<pre>

       A debugging tool or debugger is a software (that’s already available in IDE)
       which allows programmers to stop a program at any point and helps to detect and correct errors.

      When you have bugs in your program, rather than 
      scratching your head to find the bug, you can use debugger to stop program at any point and find the value of variables to detect the bug. 

      Knowing how to use a debugger is an important skill that every programmer should learn.

     <pre>
          You can create awesome softwares without knowing C programming at all. Jeff Atwood, 
          one of the creators of Stackoverflow.com, apparently doesn’t know C and 
          Stack Overflow is a really good web application.

          If you are busy and don’t want to invest time on something that doesn’t have direct effect on your day-to-day work, 
          C programming is not for you.

    C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is fast, portable and available in all platforms.

    If you are new to programming, C is a good choice to start your programming journey.

    This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started in C programming language, why you should learn it and how you can learn it.
